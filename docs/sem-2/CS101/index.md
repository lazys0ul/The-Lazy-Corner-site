# CS101 â€“ Programming for Problem Solving ðŸ’»

Welcome to the CS101 corner of *The Lazy's Corner*!  
This page is designed to give you a head start in the subject, whether you're a fresher, a junior, or someone brushing up their C basics.

## âœ¨ What to Expect from This Course

You'll start from scratch like learning how computers interpret instructions, how to write and structure code logically, and how to implement real-world algorithms in C.  
It may feel a bit overwhelming at first, especially if you're new to coding, but trust me, once you start solving problems, it becomes *addictive*.

##  From My Experience 

- In lab sessions, **we used PuTTY (Linux terminal over SSH)** to code and compile our C programs. So, get comfortable with the command line! you can also use putty in windows by adding **WSL** through the command prmpt.
- Outside labs, feel free to explore with **IDEs like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio Code** you can pick whatever feels right.
- **Practice is key**. Try coding small logic snippets daily. Even simple programs like reversing a string help in building confidence.
- If youâ€™re ever stuck then trust Stack Overflow, GeeksforGeeks, and even YouTube walkthroughs.

### *NOTE : The resources and the content to be learned will be uploaded in a different pdf files shared by your super seniors and seniors under the resources section so I am not adding anything else here same will be the case for the rest of the modules these folders for Modules will only contain the syllabus to learn and theory quiz with coding problems*
