🎓 **Resources for IMSc Mathematics and Computing**

This site includes:

-  Unit-wise notes
-  Diagrams and charts
-  Helpful resources and links
-  Revision tips and summaries
-  PYQs and Mock test/papers
-  Interactive section to practice your code and get it graded just as you submit it

## NOTE : This site is primarily built for the subjects other than those which are under the Mathematics Department (just for now) or whose resources are a hassel to find.

🛠️ Built and maintained as a semester companion, a CV-worthy hobby project, and a legacy for juniors. I have used MKDocs + Material theme, Html, CSS, animation.css for the frontend. (the backend is still in the making will soon upgrade the website to its interactive version... expect live discussion window, a progress/ syllabus tracker, score board for the practice session, an AI companion and much more)

 More subjects will be added as I move ahead!
