## üßç About Me

Hey! I‚Äôm **Pranav**, your fellow IMSc Math & Computing student.

This site started as my personal semester companion and slowly became something I hope will:
- help peers like you survive the chaos,
- act as a portfolio-worthy project,
- and serve as a legacy for juniors üíå

> It‚Äôs made with MkDocs + Material theme, customized with HTML, CSS, and animation.css.  
> A backend upgrade is on the way to make things interactive!
